# Reducers

Reducers are pure functions that specify how application state should change in response to an action.  Reducers respond with the new state which is passed to the store and then the UI.

  The flow in this app for reducers:
  
 - Import actions from types.js
 - Define initialState
 - Define how state should change based on actions
