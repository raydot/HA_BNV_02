# Protected Routes

This logic is build kinda-sorta using [this tutorial](https://blog.bitsrc.io/build-a-login-auth-app-with-the-mern-stack-part-3-react-components-88190f8db718).

According to said tutorial: 

"There is no standard way of creating protected routes in  `React`. Weâ€™ll use the logic described...by [Tyler McGinnis](https://tylermcginnis.com/react-router-protected-routes-authentication/) to create authenticated routes (routes that only certain users can access based on their auth status)."
